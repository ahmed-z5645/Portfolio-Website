I have been assigned, and work on two different projects. Firstly, we are working towards achieving an artificial intelligence model to predict surgical intention. With the ultimate goal of AI becoming a more active partner within the healthcare field, this model would be able to accelerate the rate at which surgeons are trained and act as surgical assistants within the operating room. Secondly, I have been pursuing a full-stack engineering project for a web app that utilizes the MERN stack and a developed AI model to be used within the research industry.",
